Weather comparison app 

A simple Rails application that compares the weather of 5 different cities. 


### Approach 

 - Make an intial API call (with multiple city ID's) to retrieve the information
 - Parse the JSON response and display this simply in the views 
 - The JSON has key "item", and the value is  with a list all the cities data 
 - The JSON is parsed and the data from the cities displayed in the view
