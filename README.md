Weather comparison app in 3 hours

A simple Rails application that compares the weather of 5 different cities. 


### Approach 

 - Make an intial API call (with multiple city ID's) to retrieve the information
 - Parse the JSON response and display this simply in the views 
 - The JSON has key "item", and the value is  with a list all the cities data 
 - The JSON is parsed and the data from the cities displayed in the view
 - The cities with the best weather attributes are displayed

### Improvements 
 
 - use an input form to let users choose own cities (add an API call to match input city name to id)
 - make a recommendation (unfortunately I ran out of time)
 - style the page
 - split the data onto several HTML pages
